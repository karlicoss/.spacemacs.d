* older function to search org-mode files

basically too slow and too inflexible in comparison to ripgrep  

#+begin_src elisp
(cl-defun org-files-in (path &key (archive nil))
  (let ((regex (if archive "\\.\\(org\\|org\_archive\\)$" "\\.org$"))
         (is-lockfile (lambda (s) (string-match-p "/\\.#.*" s)))
    (remove-if is-lockfile (directory-files-recursively path regex))
#+end_src
