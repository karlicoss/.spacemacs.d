* older function to search org-mode files

basically too slow and too inflexible in comparison to ripgrep  

#+begin_src elisp
(cl-defun org-files-in (path &key (archive nil))
  (let ((regex (if archive "\\.\\(org\\|org\_archive\\)$" "\\.org$"))
         (is-lockfile (lambda (s) (string-match-p "/\\.#.*" s)))
    (remove-if is-lockfile (directory-files-recursively path regex))
#+end_src


* [2019-10-20 Sun 17:40] attempt to fix unnamed bindings...
ugh. didn't really work

#+begin_src elisp

  (loop for days from 0 to 9
        do (progn
             `(defun ,(intern (format "postpone-by-%d" days)) ()
               (interactive)
               (--my/org-agenda-postpone days))
             (org-defkey org-agenda-mode-map (format "%d" days) 'postpone-by-1)))
